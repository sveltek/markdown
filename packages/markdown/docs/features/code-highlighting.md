Recommended way is to simply use the official [`@sveltek/rehype-shiki`](https://github.com/sveltek/markdown/tree/main/packages/unplugins/rehype-shiki) plugin.

Official `Shiki` plugin is preconfigured under the hood, super flexible and easy to use, so you can focus only on importing custom `themes` and `langs`.
